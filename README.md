# Binary Search Tree

## Overview

This is my implementation of a Binary Search Tree constructed in Ruby as part of the [Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It includes methods for inserting, deleting, and tree traversal.

## What I Learned

- What a balanced binary search tree is
- How to traverse a binary tree with level-order, in-order, pre-order, and post-order
- How to use a queue data structure
- Gained a greater understanding of recursion and the call stack
- How to pass blocks as parameters
